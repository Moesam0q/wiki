Welcome to the Bedrock Modding Native Wiki!

This wiki is a knowledge hub for making native mods for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

The goal of this wiki is to:
- Teach developers how to make native mods
- Teach developers how to reverse engineer the game
- Document the internal structures of the game

As Bedrock is written in C++, most topics here will assume you have prior experience with the language. If you don't know C++, you should learn the basics of the language first.
